Fix common column clearfix issue in a simpler way using CSS

I did not originally make this solution I found it <a href="http://www.bluthemes.com/blog/3/clearing-bootstrap-3-columns">here</a> and added to this solution to include all sizes. Just add this bit of CSS after the bootstrap.css in your project. This will prevent columns from not clearing left during screen resize. Typically this happens when columns take on different heights.
